<br>Introductory Researching
</h1>

<h2 align="center">Task1: Introduction</h2>
<p align="center">A brief overview of some of the most important resources available to you, and will hopefully aid you in the process of building a research methodology that works for you.
We will be looking at the following topics:
  
- An example of a research question
- Vulnerability Searching tools
- Linux Manual Pages
</p>

<h2 align="center">Task2: Example Research Question</h2>
<p align="center"><b>Steganography: </b>The art of hiding secret data in plain sight. It sounds kind of counter-intuitive, but youâ€™d be surprised how effective it is. Hiding things such as source code, passwords, IP addresses, and other confidential information in pictures, music, or other random files tends to be the last place anyone would think of finding them.

<h2 align="center">Task3: Vulnerability Searching</h2>
<p>
Content Management Systems (such as Wordpress, FuelCMS, Ghost, etc) are frequently used to make setting up a website easier, and many of these are vulnerable to various attacks. So where would we look if we wanted to exploit specific software?

The answer to that question lies in websites such as:
  
- ExploitDB
- NVD
- CVE Mitre

<h4 align="center">CVEs take the form: <b>CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER</b></h4>

ExploitDB tends to be very useful for hackers, as it often actually contains exploits that can be downloaded and used straight out of the box. It tends to be one of the first stops when you encounter software in a CTF or pentest.

If you're inclined towards the CLI on Linux, Kali comes pre-installed with a tool called "searchsploit" which allows you to search ExploitDB from your own machine. This is offline, and works using a downloaded version of the database, meaning that you already have all of the exploits already on your Kali Linux!

<h2 align="center">Task4: Manual Pages</h2>
<p>For familaring with linux commands. We need to complete Linux Fundamentals{https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals} module.
  
  <b>man command</b> which gives you access to the manual pages for most tools directly inside your terminal.
